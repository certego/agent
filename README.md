Cuckoo Agent (upgraded to Python3)
================

This repository contains the new Cuckoo Sandbox Agent. It features a more
complete REST API for performing more generic commands on a machine rather
than having a limited set of features specific to Cuckoo Sandbox usability.

As an example, [VMCloak][vmcloak] makes extensive use of the new Cuckoo Agent.
In fact, it probably uses more of the available functionality in the new
Cuckoo Agent than Cuckoo Sandbox does.
